title: High-throughput assays for drug discovery
description: Changing the way we think about fuel
long_desc:
  Our work on bioengineered assays is currently centred on two domains. The first project, undertaken in collaboration with STEMCELL Technologies and Precision NanoSystems, seeks to assemble three-dimensional, structured brain organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells for use in pre-clinical screening of hits against neurodegenerative diseases. The second project seeks to attenuate the vectorial capacity of the mosquito to spread disease by targeting its sense of smell. We are engineering the mosquito olfactory cascade into microbial hosts in order to screen behaviour-modifying compounds in a high-throughput manner.
