title: High-throughput assays for drug discovery
description: The development of novel assays for the most prevalent diseases of today
long_desc:
  Our work on bioengineered assays is currently centred on two domains. The first project, undertaken in Our work on bioengineered assays is currently centred on two domains. The first project, undertaken in collaboration with STEMCELL Technologies and Precision NanoSystems, seeks to assemble three-dimensional, structured brain organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells for use in pre-clinical screening of hits against neurodegenerative diseases. 
  <br><br>
  The second project seeks to attenuate the disease-carrying capacity of the mosquito to spread disease by targeting its sense of smell. We are engineering the mosquito olfactory cascade into microbial hosts in order to screen behaviour-modifying compounds in a high-throughput manner.

  We are also an important player in the nascent organ bioprinting community at the University of British Columbia. Prof. Yadav is one of the lead organizers of the annual ‘Printing the Future of Therapeutics in 3D’ roundtable at UBC. The event draws on leading practitioners from academia, industry and clinics and serves as the premier forum to ideate on technological trends in the field.
