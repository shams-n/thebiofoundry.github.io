    The Government of Alberta estimates the total acreage of oil sands tailings ponds to be as high as 77 square kilometers. Although these ponds provide considerable benefit by promoting water reuse and withholding the release of toxic organic compounds such as naphthenic acids, there is a critical need to rehabilitate the land and treat all remaining water. The key challenge for treating naphthenic acids is the sheer volume of tailing ponds and the dilute, yet highly toxic nature of the contaminants.
    <br><br>
    In partnership with Metabolik Technologies (www.metaboliktech.com), a company that was spun out from the lab, we are developing an engineered bacterial strain that will harness several genes obtained from microbes that naturally degrade naphthenic acids into less-toxic by-products. The engineered strain will also tolerate and respond to the presence of NAs by expressing a genetic circuit that modulates the biodegradation of NAs, serving as a biocontainment system when NAs are fully remediated. The result is a biological solution that thrives off NAs and increases treatment efficacy without additional input costs, while simultaneously expressing a ‘kill-switch’ to terminate growth once the NA concentration reaches regulated safety levels. This manipulation ensures stimulus-specific biodegradation, achieves biocontainment and obviates the ill effects associated with accidental release of genetically engineered organisms.
    <br><br> 
     Our passive, in-pond biological approach requiring limited infrastructure, allows operators to cost-effectively treat the toxicity and ensure appropriate rehabilitation of the site. The microbial solution is designed to be tightly correlated with naphthenic acid concentration, ensuring no introduction of foreign microbes into the environment.
