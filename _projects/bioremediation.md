title: Bioremediation
description: metagenomics, proteomics, to improve quality of water and soil

long_desc:
  The environmental pollution that is now widespread poses a significant risk to our well-being. Novel methods of decontamination and clean-up are required, and few alternatives are as promising as bioremediation. 
  <br>
  <br> 
  We are coupling our expertise in metagenomics, proteomics, molecular biology, metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering to develop sustainable bioremediation strategies and improve the quality of our water and soil. The BioFoundry is also part of a global network of collaborators that is striving to make our planet more habitable.
