title: Engineering novel &amp; and better bioprocesses
description: We’re re-inventing the way we extract and valorize resources   
long_desc: 
    A warming world, the threat of epidemics, our rapidly declining drug stocks, and the inefficiency of current manufacturing processes have forced the industry to reconfigure its operations along the principles of Green Chemistry & Engineering. The new paradigm emphasizes improvements in the atom and energy efficiencies, and the environmental footprint of manufacturing processes by minimizing the generation of waste, eliminating the use of toxic reagents and solvents, utilizing renewable feedstocks, designing biodegradable products, and designing processes that minimize the likelihood of accidents. To this end, we are exploiting the immense ease and efficiency with which biological systems metabolize feedstocks to extract natural resources or produce value-added chemicals and materials to design and develop replacements for traditional chemical manufacturing processes.

     Our work in biomining addresses one of the most formidable challenges facing the mining industry – the extraction and processing of low-grade, hard-to-access ores. We are working with the Bradshaw Initiative for Minerals and Mining (link to brimm.ubc.ca) and Jetti Resources to engineer synthetic microbial consortia to leach copper in packed bed reactors and subsequently deposit the metal in a carbon-neutral microbial fuel cell. 
    <br><br> 
     Similarly, we are developing innovative cyclic bioprocesses that utilize waste streams from chemical manufacturing processes as inputs to produce performance chemicals that valorize existing products or can be sold as value-added products themselves. We are currently demonstrating this concept by harnessing the metagenome of pulp and paper sludge to synthesize polymers for the production of performance paper.  
    <br><br> 
     We are also actively working on developing novel genetic circuits to bridge macroscopic bioprocess control with intracellular control of metabolism. These methods can deliver significant improvements in productivity.
