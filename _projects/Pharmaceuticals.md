  It is estimated that all the 20,000-odd drug products that have ever been approved by the US FDA interact with just 2% of the proteins found in human cells. Pharmaceutical companies have been laboring for decades to discover molecules capable of binding the other 98%. R&D expenditures are now estimated to be roughly 6 times higher than what they were 3 decades ago. Yet, candidate attrition rates from late-stage clinical trials have never been higher and new cures remain far from forthcoming. It now costs well in excess of a billion dollars and takes over a decade to discover and develop a new drug.

  Recurrent themes in the causes for candidate attrition from clinical trials suggest that the chemical space traversed by pharmaceutical companies is simply not drug-like. This is evidenced by the fact that, of the 7,000-odd polyketide natural products that have been screened thus far, as many as 20 have made it to the market. Launching an equivalent number of synthetic compounds necessitates screening 2 million molecules.

  The answer to the industry’s problems, though, could soon be at hand. We have performed pioneering work to lay the foundations of biosynthonics for drug discovery, and our work could soon pave the way to cheaper and more efficacious drugs. Briefly, biosynthonics comprises of four principal domains – design, synthesis, exploration and integration.

  Briefly, biosynthonics involves (1) exploration of biosynthetic diversity, and (2) ingenious deployment of biosynthesis for diversity- or target-orineted synthesis of pharmacoactive molecules.

  Systems biology will form an integral part of this workflow by distilling the vast amounts of gene, protein and metabolite data that have been collected in recent years into a form that can enable drug discovery by identifying new targets and therapeutic mechanisms, as well as serving as an information conduit to metabolic engineering. Additionally, since metabolic engineering emerged from the desire to expand the product portfolio of industrial biotechnology, the manufacturing processes that will be used to produce these drugs are likely to be readily scalable, sustainable, resource-efficient and environmentally benign. This promises to be a significant improvement upon conventional pharmaceutical production processes that are quite wasteful and utilize harmful solvents and raw materials.
