title: Combatting Mosquito-borne Diseases
description: Fighting Malaria with Synthetic Biology
long_desc:
  The Blood is the life, and it shall be mine. Bram Stoker might very well have been thinking about the greatest serial killer in history when he peneed those immortal words. Between them, mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus and other encephalitic viruses affect over 700 million people across the globe each year. Of these, over a million perish, and most of these deaths are concentrated in Africa. Our work is strengthening societys arsenal to combat mosquito-borne diseases. We have adopted a very innovative approach that harnesses synthetic biology to achieve this goal and our solution is highly effective and resource-efficent.
