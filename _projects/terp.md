title: Biofuels
description: Changing the way we think about fuel
long_desc:
  Ethanol may be the world’s most widely used biofuel for spark-ignition engines, but it is not a particularly good gasoline substitute. It is hygroscopic, corrosive to engines, has unfavourable fuel characteristics, and, above all, generates about a third less energy on a volumetric basis as compared to gasoline. 
  <br><br>
  So why do we still produce ethanol as a biofuel? Well, because it’s easy! What about butanol and higher alcohols then? Ditto! 
  <br><br>
  The BioFoundry is developing novel enzymes and metabolic pathways to re-cast fermentation as a platform for providing designer biofuels.  
  <br><br>
  This work, in conjunction with the development of direct lignocellulosic fermentation and related technologies that is being undertaken in other research laboratories at the University of British Columbia, could finally lead to the establishment of a biofuels manufacturing process that is competitive with traditional thermochemical-based fuel manufacturing processes.
