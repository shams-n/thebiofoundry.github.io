  We actively research and develop mechanisms for translating our work on the development of advanced bioprocesses for the production of value-added molecules to industry, and we achieve this objective through technoeconomic assessments. One of most recent contributions to technoeconomics has been the formulation of a metric
  <br>
  V-factor; A new metric for gauging the efficiency & profitability of manufacturing processes” for consideration of publication as a letter in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. The manuscript puts forward a new metric for gauging the profitability of chemical processes and their productive use of resources. We refer to the metric as the V-factor or valorization factor, jointly in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the E-factor, as well as a nod to the emergence of biomass valorization as a paradigm in chemical manufacturing. Briefly, all available metrics to evaluate green chemical processes are limited to assessing their environmental impact. The E-factor is arguably the most celebrated and utilitarian of these metrics, and is notable for its simplicity. However, there are no formulas akin to the E-factor for back-of-the envelope estimation of profitability. The V-factor fills this void and we have validated its utility by assessing over a hundred manufacturing processes. We argue that co-evaluation of the E- and V-factors will greatly facilitate the development of environmentally and economically sustainable industrial processes, and we corroborate our claims by presenting such a co-evaluation for the 12 bio-based chemicals listed by the US Department of Energy. Our results support the conjecture of subject experts that more R&D expenditures are needed in order to realize commercial feasibility of the manufacturing processes for these chemicals.
  <br>
  We strongly believe that our work will be of interest to the broad readership of ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, and will generate healthy debate about an underappreciated aspect of green chemical processes – their profitability. I hope you agree with our assessment and we anticipate your decision regarding our submission.
