title: Technoeconomics
description: Weâ€™re developing methodologies to assess and improve the economic potential of biotechnology 
long_desc:
  We actively research and develop mechanisms for translating our work on the development of advanced bioprocesses for the production of value-added molecules to industry, and we achieve this objective through technoeconomic assessments. One of most recent contributions to technoeconomics has been the formulation of a metric that facilitates rapid estimation of profitability of manufacturing processes in the new bioeconomy.
