title: Medicine-by-design
description: We’re not just assembling better therapeutics from the ground up, but our approach is also faster and cheaper    
long_desc:
  Our industry-connected research program on pharmaceutical product development is advancing a concept that we dub ‘medicine-by-design’, a fast and low-cost methodology to advance a drug molecule from concept to formulated product. The de novo design of a pharmaceutical product for a particular disease commences with computational analyses of protein-protein and gene-gene interactions associated with that disease in order to identify a promising target and a natural product that can bind to it. The molecule is subsequently synthesized in a microbial chassis through the application of metabolic and enzyme engineering. It is then suitably formulated to ensure controlled release at the intended site of action, and we have established a pipeline that facilitates rapid identification, synthesis and testing of formulations. <br><br>
  We work closely with an industrial partner, InMed Pharmaceuticals (www.inmedpharma.com). We have already demonstrated the feasibility of our approach through our work on the development of a ‘smart’ contact lens for treating glaucoma and a printable bandage for healing damaged skin in patients suffering from Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS). Both projects have led to patent filings and have been advanced to pre-clinical testing.
