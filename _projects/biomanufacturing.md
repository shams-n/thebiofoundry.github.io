description: The manipulation of metabolic pathways to optimize gene expression
long_desc:
  Natural product biosynthetic pathways typically consist of a large number of reactions that are controlled by fairly complex regulatory mechanisms. For instance, although there is no consensus regarding the exact number of reactions involved in the biosynthesis of the blockbuster anti-cancer drug paclitaxel, it is generally agreed that taxadiene, the first intermediate in the pathway, undergoes >15 transformations before it is converted to the drug. Manipulating the metabolism of simple microorganisms such as Escherichia coli to accommodate the expression of every single enzyme of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway is, therefore, an interresting challenge.

  The expression of such a large set of enzymes could potentially induce severe physiological stresses within the host. Consequently, the metabolic pathway must be suitably modified and adapted for optimal performance of the production ‘chassis’ - the host. This task necessitates application of concepts from multivariate statistics, process systems engineering and molecular biology. 
  <br><br>
  Another approach involves synthesizing an advanced intermediate that acts as a gateway molecule for TOS via the expression of a vastly smaller set of enzymes takes advantage of the core competencies of both, metabolic engineering and synthetic chemistry. The BioFoundry is leading innovation in both these domains and is pioneering the development of optimal hosts, and manufacturing schemes and platforms for the production of important pharmaceuticals.
