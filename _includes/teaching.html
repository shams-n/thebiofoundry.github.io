                <text-left><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A teacher, much like a football coach, must <b>appeal</b> 
                    to the sensibilities of his or her students. He must <b>instill</b> 
                    in them the spirit of <b>achieving</b> the impossible while keeping their 
                    feet firmly grounded in fundamentals. I was <b>fortunate</b> to have been instructed
                     by excellent teachers. My approach to teaching has been inspired by these great 
                     individuals and I <b>hope</b> to pass on the favor to a <b>new</b> generation of
                      chemical engineers.</h3>
