title: The Bohlmann Group, Michael Smith Laboratories
description: >
  Through genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and biochemical approaches, the Bohlmann laboratory is exploring two aspects of plant specialized metabolism: (1) the role it plays in plant defense, and (2) how its  genes and enzymes can be prospected for metabolic engineering of high-value bioproducts. The foundation of this research program has concentrated primarily on the terpenoid pathway, including the large gene families of terpene synthases (TPS) and cytochrome  P450s, and more recently extended into phenolic pathways.
