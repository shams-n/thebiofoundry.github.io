                <p><b>The BioFoundry at the University of British Columbia</b> is a multidisciplinary research group that specialises in the development of green and sustainable chemical manufacturing processes and novel environmental remediation strategies. Our research group is at the forefront of innovation in a strategic domain for Canada and British Columbia. We utilise cutting-edge tools and technogloies to preicsely modulate and control the metabolic networks of microoganisms to produce cleaner fuels and more efficcacious drugs, as well as mop up pollution from the environment.</p>

                    <p>The oil industry has provided society with great wealth and power, fuel and energy, and materials and medicines for over 150 years. No force has shaped human society quite like oil has. But then again, neither has any other industry had as deleterious an impact on the environment.</p>
                    <p>Carbon dioxide released by the combustion of oil products has turned the planet into a sweltering greenhouse. Oceans are warming and glaciers are melting away, causing sea levels to rise, and if this trend persists, human settlements in low-lying coastal areas could soon be inundated with sea water.</p>
                    <p>A warming world also threatens to unleash infectious diseases like never before. Unfortunately, though, antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Some microorganisms have already developed resistance to multiple drugs, and fewer antimicrobial drugs are being approved for use each year.</p>

        <p>Ethanol may be the world's most widely used biofuel for spark-ignition engines, but it is not a particularly good gasoline substitute. It is hygroscopic, corrosive to engines, has unfavourable fuel characteristics, and, above all, generates about a third less energy on a volumetric basis as compared to gasoline.</p>
