 We  employ  synthetic  biology  and  interdisciplinary  bioengineering  toward  the
 design  and  development  of  next-generation,  green  chemical  processes  for  the
 manufacture  of  cleaner  fuels,  superior  medicines  and  novel  materials.

  <p>The oil industry has provided society with great wealth and power, fuel and energy, and materials and medicines for over 150 years. No force has shaped human society quite like oil has. But then again, neither has any other industry had as deleterious an impact on the environment.</p>
  <p>Carbon dioxide released by the combustion of oil products has turned the planet into a sweltering greenhouse. Oceans aWe specialise in the design and development of next-generation, green chemical processes for the manufacture of cleaner fuels, superior medicines and novel materials.re warming and glaciers are melting away, causing sea levels to rise, and if this trend persists, human settlements in low-lying coastal areas could soon be inundated with sea water.</p>
  <p>A warming world also threatens to unleash infectious diseases like never before. Unfortunately, though, antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Some microorganisms have already developed resistance to multiple drugs, and fewer antimicrobial drugs are being approved for use each year.</p>
